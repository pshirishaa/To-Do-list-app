# To-Do-list-app
DESCRIPTION

The provided To-Do List application is a simple yet functional task management tool designed for effective task organization. Here's a brief description of its key features and components:

1. User Interface:
The application has a clean and user-friendly interface with a centralized container to manage tasks.
Input fields include task title, description, due date, priority levels (low, medium, high), and task category.
A button labeled "Add Task" allows users to input task details and add them to the task list.



2. Task Management:
Tasks are represented by an object with properties such as title, description, due date, priority, category, and status (initially set to "New").
Task information is stored in the browser's local storage for persistent data across sessions.


3. Displaying Tasks:
The application dynamically displays the list of tasks in a designated task list container.
Each task is presented with key details, including the task title, description, due date, priority, category, and status.


4. Task Status:
Tasks can be marked with different statuses such as "New," "In Progress," or "Completed." However, this implementation does not currently include functionality to change the status.


5. Styling:
The user interface is styled using CSS to enhance readability and provide a visually appealing experience.

6. Clear Form Functionality:
After adding a task, the form is cleared for convenience, allowing users to input new tasks without manual clearing.


7. Initialization:
The application initializes by displaying existing tasks stored in local storage when the page is loaded.


9. Limitations:
The example lacks comprehensive validation and error handling for simplicity, and it does not include features like task editing or deletion.
